# Adapt or Die
In this episode of Adapt or Die, we build a game where AI organisms fight to survive against the harsh realities of nature.

A playable version is available at [https://neontomo.com/play/adapt-or-die](https://neontomo.com/play/adapt-or-die)

I made a YouTube video describing my entire thought process: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZtqoAKIKg8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZtqoAKIKg8)

Feel free to modify my code however you wish, but credit me in the source code.
